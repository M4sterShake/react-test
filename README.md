# React Interview Exercise

In order to prepare for the interview, please pull this repo and run the following commands in this directory:

To install the apps dependencies:
```
npm install
```

To run the app:

```
npm start
```

You will need node v12.22.7 or greater installed to run these commands.

Once they are run, a browser should open displaying the text "Hello, World!". If this is the case then you're all set.

On the day of your interview we will update this branch to include an exercise that we'll ask you to complete during the interview.

# Exercise Instructions

This package is a react app with a intentional performance problems.

The app renders a long list of components that can be selected, but it takes a long time for the item to be visually updated when the user clicks on it because of the performance issues.

Please try and determine the reason for the poor performance and make changes to improve it.

You can adjust the length of the list variable in BigList.js to alter the performance if its too fast or slow on your computer.
