# React Interview Exercise

In order to prepare for the interview, please pull the code and run the following commands in this directory:

To install the apps dependencies:
```
npm install
```

To run the app:

```
npm start
```

You will need node v12.22.7 or greater installed to run these commands.

Once they are run, a browser should open displaying the text "Hello, World!". If this is the case then you're all set.

On the day of your interview we will update this branch to include an exercise that we'll ask you to complete during the interview.
